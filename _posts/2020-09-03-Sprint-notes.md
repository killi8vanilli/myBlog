## Notes on Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ides in Just Five Days

The authors take the reader on a journey into a sprint week. Sprint is an innovative technique that answers questions about business courses and testing its new ideas. It can be used for different products - services, documentation, physical product or electronic interfaces - and across all kinds of companies.
I praise this book for its straightforwardness and use of many real-world examples that helped me immerse myself in the team's situation and understand the process and effect that each step of a Sprint brings.

**Negatives:** Employees involved have to dedicate full attention to this project for one week.


# Environment

Sprint day usually lasts just six hours with a good amount of breaks in between, since active participation requires a great amount of focus and energy. Hence electronic devices during sprint sessions are a no-no.

# Team

The size of a sprint team should be up to 7 people. More is not advised, since it slows down the pace of the process. It's also advised that you include the company's "Troublemaker". This person usually supplies different points of view and works as an opposing side, which stimulates other team members to work on strong arguments for presented ideas.

**Risk**: The role of The Decider is normally given to the CEO of the company. This role is crucial in decision making, so it's vital that the CEO is present at least at certain times in the process, or that she passes over full decision-making authority to other member.

**The Facilitator** is the main protagonist in sprint process. This should be the person who shows curiosity for company's problem, asks a lot of "5W's and H" questions, diligently takes notes and on top of that knows how to motivate fellow members.

# Monday

- set a **long term goal**; motivation behind this project, what future holds. Optimistic approach.
- Define **list of sprint questions**; fears. Pessimistic approach.
- Make a **map;** team creates flowchart with main players on the left and end goal on the right side.
- include **extra experts**; outside guests that make our team well informed with the product - how it works, known issues, report history etc.
    - **How Might We** notes - we add this "problems re-framed into opportunities " to our map.
- The Decider picks **the target customer** and **target moment** on the map.
- It's important to note, that its completely normal and expected that team updates long term goal and list of questions several times along the day.

# Tuesday

- **Lightning Demos** - Research available solutions within and outside your company. Present, team records good finds.
- **The 4-step Sketch**. Each team member sketches her solution.
- Recruit volunteers for Friday's testing

# Wednesday

- Preform "**Sticky decision**" technique:
    - **Art museum - Heat map - Speed critique - Straw poll - Supervote**. Solutions are gathered and examined. Members vote on favorite ideas, discuss it, and make another vote. The Decider has the final "super vote" - her idea is going to be made into a prototype and be tested.
- Rumble or All-in-one - Team has to decide how are winning ideas going to be prototyped. Can they join them together into one solution or are they going to implement them in two different, competing prototypes?
- **Storyboard** it should include 5 to 15 steps. The opening scene should present a place where a customer is expected to encounter the product. Implement sketched solutions in the storyboard.

# Thursday

- **Prototyping should be done with tools that enable quick and not refined work, but still offer a satisfying level of realism, .**
- Roles in prototyping process: Maker (creative shaping solutions into a prototype), Stitcher (Ensures there is consistency and continuity in the prototype), Writer (Interview script), Asset Collector (gathers assets for makers), and Interviewer.
- The prototype should seem realistic, but not refined, since it can take too much valuable time and energy.

# Friday

- **2 rooms - interview room and team room.** The team will follow the interview in real-time, take notes, and try to identify emerging patterns.
- Only **5 volunteers** are needed for effective testing (N n N group research).
- The interviewer conducts "**FIve-Act Interview**". Acts are proposed in a way so volunteers smoothly ease in the interview, so they are relaxed and are comfortable expressing more opinions.
- I found "broken questions" advice useful. In the process of testing interviewer starts with a question (What, how, so...) and then his voice fades into silence, so he never gives away what the question was about. But this deed nudges the volunteer to start explaining what's on their mind. I think this approach takes a lot of mindfulness and practice.
- At the end of the day, the team reviews notes and identifies patterns.
